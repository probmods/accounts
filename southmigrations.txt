INITIALIZATION (restarting):
1) comment out all the apps, except for contrib stuff 
2) run syncdb once so that southhistory gets migrated
3) uncomment the apps and run this line PER APP
"$ ./manage.py schemamigration APPNAME --initial"


4) run this PER APP
 	./manage.py migrate APPNAME

5) all ready!
